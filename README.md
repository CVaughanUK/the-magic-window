# the magic window
the magic window - an fft visualiser <br />
        the magic window allows users to see into the eye of the frequency domain<br />
        there are three different visualisations to gaze at<br />
        use the controls on the top left to spawn in different shapes<br />
        you can alter properties of the shapes<br />
        audio input can either be a sample wave or aphex twin<br /> <br />
